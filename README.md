# Conjure API

Conjure API client

##### Running with ngrok

GitHub needs public URLs. You can use ngrok to make your localhost public.

1. download ngrok
2. place ngrok executable at `~/ngrok`
3. run `~/ngrok http 2999`
4. copy the forwarded (non-https) domain name (without the protocol) into `.profile`
5. keep ngrok running while you develop
6. restart the app
